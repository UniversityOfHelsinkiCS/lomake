## Short tutorial

The project is split into 2 parts: client and server while index.js in root works as the main file. The project contains no database dependant parts.

### How to start development

1. git clone
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run dev`
4. run `docker exec -it lomake_dev bash -c "node index.js seed"` OR obtain a database dump and use that while developing (see [this page](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-restore-database/))
5. go to http://localhost:8000

### Changing logged in user while developing

Use setHeaders() to select user for development purposes.

### Accessing the database while developing

1. run `docker exec -it lomake_db bash`
2. enter with `psql -U postgres` 

### Seeding the database for production

When deploying Lomake to a production server for the first time, the database should be seeded.

The seeding should be performed only **once** by executing `docker exec -it lomake bash -c "node index.js seed"`

### Running Cypress tests

There's quite a lot of end-to-end tests in the cypress/integration folder.

To run these tests, simply execute `npm run cypress:open` and select _Run all specs_ from the GUI.

### ApiConnection

ApiConnection is a custom redux middleware that is used in most toska software. It is used to simplify redux usage by wrapping axios.

You can see redux example using apiConnection in client/components/MessageComponent.

## questions.json

## IAMs

This project uses IAMs for access control. You can find the IAM-based access configs in ```config > IAMConfig.js```. In Lomake itself admins can find a table of different access types and corresponding IAM-groups (```OSPA > IAM-ryhmät```).
